  ***Description:*** I took part in the ["Moving Meditations" CG animation challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0OvHVJV_XU&t=60s) on YouTube in 2022. I modeled my creation using Maya, then set up the environment and camera in Unreal Engine. I touched up the object's UV and material using 3ds Maxs and brought my character to life by rigging its bones in Blender. Finally, I added some effects like fog, clouds, and a rainy effect using bluePrint in Unreal Engine before rendering it all into a sequence.
